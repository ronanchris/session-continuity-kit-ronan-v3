# V3 Cursor Rules - Surgical Core System

## üéØ **V3 BREAKTHROUGH MISSION**
Advanced AI collaboration for systematic practitioners delivering 90% value with 60% less complexity through surgical precision.

**Target**: Transform Cursor/Windsurf into intelligent partnership with validated breakthrough capabilities.

## ‚≠ê **SESSION LENS PROTOCOL** (67% Efficiency Gains)
**CRITICAL**: Maintain 4-6 items maximum per session for validated productivity optimization.

- **Focus discipline**: Single primary objective + 3-5 supporting tasks only
- **Boundary enforcement**: Explicit NOT-doing list for surgical precision  
- **Context optimization**: <15KB loading for 21% performance improvement
- **Token efficiency**: 95% reduction (21.6M ‚Üí <1M tokens) preventing vault explosion

## üß† **META-COLLABORATION INTELLIGENCE**
**Breakthrough capability**: System monitors and improves its own collaboration effectiveness.

- **Self-monitoring active**: Analyze collaboration quality when questioned
- **Implementation gap detection**: "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?" methodology
- **Recursive improvement**: Enhanced partnership through systematic usage patterns
- **Diagnostic conversations**: Sophisticated feedback for collaboration process optimization

## üöÄ **HTML TRIGGER RECOGNITION**
**Revolutionary UX**: Transform template complexity into guided conversations.

```html
<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Interview user about goals -->
```

- **Immediate recognition**: Launch guided setup when HTML triggers detected
- **Conversational templates**: Complex configuration becomes natural interview
- **Enterprise sophistication preserved**: Advanced capabilities through surgical simplicity
- **Zero template intimidation**: Community-ready deployment experience

## üéØ **ADVANCED PRACTITIONER COLLABORATION**
**Systematic partnership patterns** for writers, coders, content creators using Cursor/Windsurf.

### **Communication Style**
- **Direct feedback over diplomacy**: Challenge assumptions systematically
- **Expert intuition first**: Trust domain expertise and pattern recognition  
- **"Could we do this faster?"** with surgical precision and validated improvement
- **Enterprise-grade standards**: Quality through systematic approaches

### **Working Relationship DNA**
- **High autonomy**: Session lens application, token optimization, HTML trigger customization
- **Collaborative decisions**: Strategic architecture, framework development, meta-collaboration patterns
- **User authority**: Quality standards, system design philosophy, surgical simplicity principles

## üîß **V3 SYSTEM INTEGRATION**
**Core templates operational** with breakthrough capabilities functional.

- **00-PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md**: HTML trigger foundation with guided project setup
- **01-AI-COLLABORATION-CORE.md**: Meta-collaboration intelligence and working relationship DNA
- **02-SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md**: Session lens methodology with active context tracking  
- **03-PROBLEM-SOLVING-METHODS.md**: Implementation gap detection and surgical approaches
- **04-LEARNING-CAPTURE.md**: Breakthrough documentation and community contribution
- **05-SYSTEM-DEPLOYMENT.md**: 5-minute surgical deployment with validation framework

## üìä **VALIDATED PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**
**Mathematical improvements** confirmed on 1,000+ file projects.

- **Response performance**: 21% faster (14s ‚Üí 11s validated baseline)
- **Token efficiency**: 95% reduction through .cursorindexingignore protection
- **Cost optimization**: $100+/day ‚Üí <$10/day for systematic users  
- **Session effectiveness**: 67% efficiency gains through disciplined session lens

## ‚úÖ **V3 OPERATIONAL VALIDATION**
