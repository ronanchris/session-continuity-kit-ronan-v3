# Problem-Solving Methods - V3 Surgical Precision

<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Configure systematic problem-solving for advanced practitioners using Cursor/Windsurf. Set up implementation gap detection, surgical approach, and real-world validation delivering 90% value with 60% less complexity. -->

## üéØ **V3 Core Problem-Solving Methods**

### **1. Implementation Gap Detection** ‚≠ê **V3 BREAKTHROUGH**

**Core Question**: *"If system were working optimally, wouldn't X happen automatically?"*

**Surgical Process**:
1. **Identify designed behavior** - What should happen if system works as intended
2. **Observe actual behavior** - What's actually happening in practice  
3. **Diagnose gap** - Systematic difference between design and reality
4. **Apply surgical fix** - Targeted solution vs comprehensive overhaul

**Advanced Practitioner Example**:
- **Expected**: HTML triggers launch guided conversations
- **Actual**: Static comments without AI response
- **Gap**: Cursor rules not recognizing trigger patterns
- **Fix**: Update .cursor/rules/ with trigger recognition

### **2. Surgical Approach** ‚≠ê **ROOT CAUSE FOCUS**

**Principle**: Target root cause with precision, ignore symptoms and complexity overhead.

**Advanced Practitioner Process**:
1. **Expert intuition first** - Trust domain expertise and pattern recognition
2. **Isolate variables** - Test specific hypotheses vs comprehensive debugging
3. **Validate with real data** - Production scenarios, not toy examples
4. **Measure improvement** - 21% performance targets, efficiency validation

**Recent Success Pattern**:
- **Problem**: Cursor consuming $100+/day with slow responses
- **Root Cause**: Token explosion (21.6M+) causing AI confusion
- **Surgical Solution**: .cursorindexingignore implementation
- **Result**: 95% token reduction, 21% faster responses, <$10/day cost

### **3. Real-World Validation** ‚≠ê **PRODUCTION TESTING**

**Advanced Practitioner Standard**: Battle-test with actual workflows before deployment.

**Validation Protocol**:
1. **Production data** - Real project files, actual user scenarios
2. **Performance measurement** - Response time, token usage, efficiency gains
3. **Complete workflow testing** - End-to-end systematic verification
4. **Edge case validation** - Complex configurations, large files, limits

## üî¨ **V3 Diagnostic Framework**

### **Problem Classification for Advanced Practitioners**

**Performance Issues**: Apply surgical precision + session lens methodology  
**Context Problems**: Use meta-collaboration intelligence + active context tracking  
**Integration Issues**: Implementation gap detection + systematic validation  

### **Quality Issue Detection**
- **Performance degradation**: >14s responses, >15KB context, cost explosion
- **Context drift**: Session lens violated (>6 items), scattered focus
- **Tool integration failure**: Rules not executing, triggers not responding

### **Advanced Practitioner Decision Framework**
1. **Expert pattern recognition** - Trust domain expertise first
2. **Systematic hypothesis testing** - Isolated variable validation
3. **Implementation gap analysis** - Design vs reality comparison
4. **Surgical intervention** - Targeted fixes maintaining system integrity
