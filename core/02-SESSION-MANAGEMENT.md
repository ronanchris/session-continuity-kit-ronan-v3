# Session Management - V3 Surgical Core

<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Configure session lens methodology for advanced practitioners using Cursor/Windsurf. Set up 4-6 item focus system delivering validated 67% efficiency gains with active context tracking and interruption recovery. -->

## üéØ **Session Lens Methodology (4-6 Items Maximum)**

**Breakthrough Achievement**: **67% efficiency gains** through mathematical focus optimization validated on 1,000+ file projects.

**V3 Surgical Principle**: Working memory optimized for 3-7 items. >6 items = context switching overhead. 4-6 items = surgical precision.

### **Current Session Focus**

#### **Primary Objective** (Single Core Mission)
<!-- Today's primary outcome that defines session success -->

#### **Supporting Tasks** (3-5 Maximum Only)
1. **<!-- Essential task -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->
2. **<!-- Required task -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->  
3. **<!-- Critical task -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->
4. **<!-- Optional if essential -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->
5. **<!-- Only if absolutely critical -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->

#### **Surgical Boundaries** (Essential for 67% Efficiency)
**NOT doing today**: <!-- Explicit scope exclusions -->
**Future session**: <!-- Important items deliberately deferred -->
**Performance target**: <15KB context for 21% improvement

## üîÑ **Active Session Context & Interruption Recovery**

### **Current Working State** (Real-Time Tracking)
- **Exact location**: <!-- File, function, paragraph currently working on -->
- **Tool state**: <!-- What's loaded, connections active, configurations -->
- **Thought process**: <!-- Current reasoning, next planned action -->
- **Recovery point**: <!-- Where to cleanly resume after interruption -->

### **Interruption Recovery Protocol** (60-Second Restoration)

**Before Interruption** (30 seconds):
- [ ] **Micro-context**: Exact location and current problem
- [ ] **Thought state**: Current reasoning and next action
- [ ] **Tool state**: Active connections and configurations
- [ ] **Recovery breadcrumb**: Trail back to exact working point

**After Interruption** (30 seconds):
- [ ] **Context restoration**: Follow breadcrumb to exact state
- [ ] **Session lens check**: Validate 4-6 items still optimal
- [ ] **Tool recovery**: Restore connections and focus
- [ ] **Momentum restoration**: Resume from interruption point

## üìä **Session Progress & Performance**

### **Progress Dashboard**
- **‚úÖ Completed**: <!-- Achievements with impact measure -->
- **üîÑ Active**: <!-- Current focus with status and next actions -->
- **‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked**: <!-- Blockers with resolution plan -->
- **üöÄ Next Session**: <!-- Immediate priorities for next session -->

### **V3 Performance Optimization**
- **Session lens discipline**: 4-6 items maintained for 67% efficiency
- **Token efficiency**: <15KB context for 21% performance improvement
- **Meta-collaboration**: System monitoring and improving collaboration quality
- **Cost tracking**: Progress toward $100+/day ‚Üí <$10/day optimization

## üöÄ **Session Entrance Protocol (90 Seconds)**

### **Quick Context Restoration**
- **Primary focus**: <!-- Single session goal -->
- **Supporting tasks**: <!-- 3-5 maximum -->
- **Boundaries**: <!-- What we're NOT doing -->
- **Tool readiness**: <!-- Connections and configurations needed -->

### **Advanced Practitioner Context**
- **Project identity**: <!-- Core mission and value -->
- **Technical stack**: <!-- Primary tools and Cursor/Windsurf integration -->
- **Previous session**: <!-- Last outcome and handoff context -->
- **Working relationship**: <!-- Collaboration patterns and communication style -->

## ‚úÖ **Session Success Validation**

**Essential Metrics Only:**
- [ ] **Session lens maintained**: 4-6 items maximum throughout session
- [ ] **67% efficiency achieved**: Focused work vs scattered approach
- [ ] **Performance optimized**: <15KB context, 21% improvement
- [ ] **Active context preserved**: Exact working state for next session
- [ ] **Meta-collaboration active**: System self-monitoring operational

**Success Indicator**: Advanced practitioner achieves systematic productivity with breakthrough capabilities and seamless session continuity.

## üéØ **V3 Session Intelligence**

### **Session Lens Adaptation**
When scope threatens 4-6 item limit:
1. **Pause and assess**: Current effectiveness vs 67% efficiency target
2. **Surgical adjustment**: Preserve momentum, refocus on highest value
3. **Validate change**: Maintain item limit, document learning

### **Implementation Gap Detection**
**"If system were working, wouldn't X happen?"**
- Session lens maintained automatically without manual effort
- Context restoration working seamlessly across interruptions
- Tool integration performing at optimization levels
- Collaboration improving through systematic usage
