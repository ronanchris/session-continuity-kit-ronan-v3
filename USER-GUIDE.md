## üöÄ **Quick Start - 5 Minutes to Revolutionary AI Collaboration**

### **1. Deploy V3 Surgical Core** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Token protection
cp cursorindexingignore.template .cursorindexingignore

# Core templates  
cp -r session-continuity-core/ ./

# Cursor rules
cp starter-kit/cursor-rules.template.mdc .cursor/rules/session-continuity-v3.mdc
```

### **2. Test Breakthrough Capabilities** (2 minutes)
- **Restart Cursor** to recognize new rules
- **Open any template** in session-continuity-core/
- **Experience HTML triggers** - AI should offer guided setup automatically
- **Verify meta-collaboration** - Ask: "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?"

### **3. Validate Performance** (1 minute)
- [ ] **HTML triggers responsive** - Templates launch guided conversations
- [ ] **Session lens active** - Natural focus on 4-6 items maximum
- [ ] **Meta-collaboration operational** - AI provides self-diagnosis when questioned
- [ ] **Token optimization working** - Faster responses, lower costs

**Success**: Revolutionary AI collaboration operational with enterprise-grade reliability!
