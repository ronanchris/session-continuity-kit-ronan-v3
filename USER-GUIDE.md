## üîÑ **Upgrading Your V3 System**

### **When to Upgrade**

**Upgrade Detection Signals**:
- [ ] **Repository updates** - New commits to session-continuity-kit-ronan-v3
- [ ] **Enhanced capabilities** - Framework improvements or new breakthrough features
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Validated efficiency gains or cost reductions
- [ ] **Community contributions** - Advanced practitioner enhancements merged

**Upgrade Readiness Check**:
```bash
# Check if your system has customizations worth preserving
grep -r "<!-- " core/ | wc -l  # Should show minimal placeholder comments
ls core/*.md | wc -l           # Should show 6 core templates
```

### **Complete Upgrade Workflow**

**4-Phase Surgical Upgrade Process** using prompt-library upgrade system:

#### **Phase 1: Extraction** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Execute upgrade-extraction.md prompt
# Purpose: Systematically preserve all user customizations
```

**What Happens**:
- Scans all 6 core templates for customized content
- Creates `upgrade-temp/` directory with indexed extraction files
- Generates `user-customizations-index.md` with restoration roadmap
- Maps every placeholder replacement to precise restoration locations

**Expected Output**:
```
upgrade-temp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-project-requirements-customizations.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-ai-collaboration-customizations.md  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-session-management-customizations.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04-problem-solving-customizations.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05-learning-capture-customizations.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 06-system-deployment-customizations.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-customizations-index.md
```

#### **Phase 2: Validation** (3 minutes)
```bash
# Execute upgrade-validation.md prompt
# Purpose: Verify extraction integrity before framework update
```

**Quality Assurance**:
- Confirms all 6 templates successfully scanned
- Validates customization capture completeness  
- Tests restoration mapping accuracy
- Ensures rollback capability before proceeding

**Success Criteria**: All customizations extracted and mapped with precision

#### **Phase 3: Framework Update** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Apply new V3 template versions
cp -r session-continuity-kit-ronan-v3/core/* ./core/
```

**What Gets Updated**:
- Enhanced HTML trigger sophistication
- Improved meta-collaboration intelligence capabilities
- Optimized session lens methodology
- Advanced performance optimization features

#### **Phase 4: Restoration** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Execute upgrade-restoration.md prompt  
# Purpose: Intelligently merge preserved content with V3 improvements
```

**Intelligent Merging**:
- Maps user content to new template structures
- Preserves customizations while maintaining V3 enhancements
- Handles structural changes through conflict resolution
- Maintains both user preferences and framework improvements

### **What to Expect During Upgrade**

#### **Extraction Phase Expectations**

```bash
# Re-run extraction with specific focus
# Check for placeholder patterns not recognized
grep -r "<!-- " core/ | grep -v "AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER"
# Manually document any custom patterns found
```

#### **Scenario 2: Validation Failures**
**Symptoms**: upgrade-validation.md reports integrity issues
**Resolution**:
- Review specific validation failures listed
- Manually verify flagged customizations in upgrade-temp/
- Correct extraction files before proceeding
- Re-run validation until clean success

#### **Scenario 3: Restoration Conflicts**
**Symptoms**: User content doesn't fit new template structure
**Resolution**:
- **Review conflict details** in restoration phase output
- **Apply manual mapping** for complex structural changes
- **Preserve intent over format** - maintain user meaning in new framework
- **Document adaptations** for future reference

#### **Scenario 4: HTML Trigger Integration Issues**
**Symptoms**: Enhanced triggers don't work with restored content
**Resolution**:
```bash
# Verify trigger patterns updated correctly
grep -r "AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER" core/
# Test each trigger individually with AI
# Confirm interview responses preserved alongside enhanced patterns
```

#### **Scenario 5: Performance Regression**
**Symptoms**: System slower or less efficient after upgrade
**Resolution**:
- Verify .cursorindexingignore still present and functional
- Check session lens methodology working with restored content
- Confirm meta-collaboration intelligence operational
- Test V3 performance optimizations active

### **Rollback Procedures**

#### **When to Rollback**
- **Verification fails** - Critical issues detected in upgrade-verification.md
- **Functionality lost** - Essential features non-operational after upgrade
- **Data corruption** - User customizations incorrectly restored
- **Performance degradation** - System worse than pre-upgrade state

#### **Emergency Rollback Process**
```bash
# Step 1: Immediate rollback initiation
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è INITIATING EMERGENCY ROLLBACK"

# Step 2: Restore pre-upgrade template state
# (Ensure backup exists before starting upgrade)
cp -r backup/core-pre-upgrade/* core/

# Step 3: Manual customization restoration
# Use upgrade-temp/user-customizations-index.md for manual restoration
# Apply user content to original template locations

# Step 4: Verify rollback success
# Test essential functionality
# Confirm HTML triggers work
# Verify user customizations present
# Check AI collaboration responds properly

# Step 5: Document rollback reason
echo "üìù Document reason for rollback to improve future upgrades"
```

#### **Post-Rollback Recovery**
1. **Validate original functionality** restored completely
2. **Preserve upgrade-temp/** data for future upgrade attempts
3. **Document specific failure points** for systematic improvement
