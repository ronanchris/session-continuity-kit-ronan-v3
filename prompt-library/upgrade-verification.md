### **Phase 3: V3 Framework Validation**

#### **Core V3 Capabilities Verification**

**Meta-Collaboration Intelligence Testing**:
```bash
# Test meta-collaboration self-monitoring
# Ask AI: "How effective is our current collaboration? What could be improved?"
```

**Expected Response Validation**:

- [ ] **Implementation Gap Detection** - "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?" methodology functional
- [ ] **Recursive Improvement** - System provides actionable enhancement suggestions
- [ ] **User Context Integration** - Meta-analysis incorporates user customizations

**Session Lens Methodology Testing**:
```bash
# Verify 4-6 item focus system operational
cat core/02-SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md | grep -A 10 "Supporting Tasks"
```

**Session Efficiency Validation**:

- [ ] **Surgical Boundaries** - NOT-doing list actively enforced
- [ ] **Performance Target** - <15KB context for 21% improvement maintained
- [ ] **Focus Discipline** - Single primary objective with supporting tasks only

**Performance Optimization Verification**:
```bash
# Check token efficiency measures
ls -la .cursorindexingignore 2>/dev/null && echo "Token protection active" || echo "Token protection missing"
```

**Performance Metrics Validation**:
- [ ] **Token Protection** - .cursorindexingignore preventing vault explosion
- [ ] **Response Performance** - 21% improvement baseline maintained
- [ ] **Cost Optimization** - Smart model routing operational
- [ ] **Context Efficiency** - Surgical precision with user content preserved

#### **Cross-Template Integration Testing**

**Block Reference Validation**:
```bash
# Test cross-references work correctly
grep -r "\^project-mission" core/
grep -r "\^technical-architecture" core/
grep -r "\^session-management" core/
```

**Integration Checklist**:

- [ ] **Context Priority** - High/medium/low prioritization operational
- [ ] **Session IDs** - Unique identifiers maintained and functional

### **Phase 4: Rollback Readiness Assessment**

#### **Backup Verification**

**Confirm Rollback Capability**:
```bash
# Verify upgrade-temp/ contains complete restoration data
ls -la upgrade-temp/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Archive location check needed"
ls -la archive/upgrade-*/2>/dev/null || echo "Archive created during cleanup"
```

**Rollback Preparation Checklist**:
- [ ] **Original Extraction Data** - Complete user customizations preserved
- [ ] **Pre-Upgrade Backup** - Original template state recoverable
- [ ] **Restoration Index** - Complete mapping available for rollback
- [ ] **Clean Rollback Path** - Clear instructions for reverting changes

#### **Rollback Instructions** (Execute Only If Verification Fails)

**Emergency Rollback Protocol**:
```bash
# ONLY EXECUTE IF VERIFICATION FAILS

# Step 1: Stop using upgraded templates immediately
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFICATION FAILED - INITIATING ROLLBACK"

# Step 2: Restore pre-upgrade state from backup
# (Requires backup location - adjust path as needed)
cp -r backup/core-pre-upgrade/* core/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Backup location verification needed"

# Step 3: Restore user customizations to original locations
# Use upgrade-temp/user-customizations-index.md to manually restore content

# Step 4: Verify rollback successful
echo "üîÑ Rollback initiated - Manual verification required"
echo "1. Check core/ templates contain your customizations"
echo "2. Verify HTML triggers function as before upgrade"
echo "3. Confirm session context and active work preserved"
echo "4. Test AI collaboration responds to your preferences"

# Step 5: Report rollback reason for system improvement
echo "üìù REPORT: Document verification failure cause for future improvement"
```

### **Phase 5: Cleanup & Completion**

#### **Successful Verification Cleanup**

**Post-Verification Cleanup Protocol**:
```bash
# Execute ONLY after complete verification success

# Archive extraction data for reference
mkdir -p archive/upgrade-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)/
cp -r upgrade-temp/* archive/upgrade-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)/ 2>/dev/null || echo "upgrade-temp already archived"

# Clean up temporary upgrade files
rm -rf upgrade-temp/ 2>/dev/null || echo "upgrade-temp already cleaned"

# Confirm cleanup
echo "‚úÖ Cleanup complete - upgrade-temp archived and removed"
```

#### **Final System Validation**

**Complete System Health Check**:
```bash
# Final verification of operational system
echo "üéØ FINAL SYSTEM VALIDATION"

# 1. Template count verification
TEMPLATE_COUNT=$(ls core/*.md | wc -l)
echo "Core templates: $TEMPLATE_COUNT/6"

# 2. Customization content check (no placeholders remaining)
PLACEHOLDER_COUNT=$(grep -r "<!-- " core/ | wc -l)
echo "Placeholder comments remaining: $PLACEHOLDER_COUNT"

# 3. Block reference integrity
BLOCK_REF_COUNT=$(grep -r "\^[a-z-]*" core/ | wc -l)
echo "Block references functional: $BLOCK_REF_COUNT"

# 4. HTML trigger count
TRIGGER_COUNT=$(grep -r "AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER" core/ | wc -l)
echo "HTML triggers operational: $TRIGGER_COUNT/6"
```
