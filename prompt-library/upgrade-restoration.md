# Upgrade Restoration - Intelligent Customization Recovery

## üéØ **Mission**
Intelligently restore preserved user customizations to updated V3 Session Continuity Kit templates while maintaining both framework improvements and personalized content integrity.

## üß† **Intelligent Restoration Protocol**

### **Phase 1: Index Analysis & Restoration Planning**

**Read Restoration Roadmap**:
```bash
# Load the extraction index for restoration planning
cat upgrade-temp/user-customizations-index.md
```

**Generate Restoration Strategy**:
1. **Parse extraction summary** - Understand scope and complexity
2. **Analyze customization inventory** - Map priorities and restoration order
3. **Review detailed roadmap** - Identify critical, important, and optional content
4. **Plan conflict resolution** - Prepare for structural changes in new templates

### **Phase 2: Template Structure Mapping**

**Compare Old vs New Template Structures**:

For each core template, analyze:
- **HTML Trigger Evolution** - New interview patterns vs preserved responses
- **Section Reorganization** - Heading changes, new sections, deprecated areas
- **Placeholder Updates** - Modified comment patterns, new customization points
- **Block Reference Changes** - Updated anchor links and cross-references

**Intelligent Mapping Strategy**:
```markdown
# Restoration Mapping Logic

## Content Type Recognition:
- **Project-Specific Data** ‚Üí Always restore to equivalent new locations
- **Framework Configuration** ‚Üí Merge with V3 improvements intelligently
- **Active Session Context** ‚Üí Restore with priority, update to new structure
- **Custom Methodologies** ‚Üí Preserve in enhanced framework sections
- **Learning Artifacts** ‚Üí Migrate to improved documentation structure
```

### **Phase 3: Priority-Based Restoration**

#### **üî¥ CRITICAL - Restore First** (Zero Tolerance for Loss)

**Project Identity & Technical Foundation**:
```bash
# Restore core project customizations
# Source: upgrade-temp/01-project-requirements-customizations.md
```

**Target Locations in Updated Templates**:
- **Project Mission** (`^project-mission`)
  - `**What We're Building**:` ‚Üê Restore user project purpose
  - `**Success Criteria**:` ‚Üê Restore user success metrics
  - `**Timeline**:` ‚Üê Restore user timeline/scope
  - `**Why This Matters**:` ‚Üê Restore user strategic importance

- **Technical Architecture** (`^technical-architecture`)
  - `**Core Stack**:` ‚Üê Restore user technology stack
  - `**System Design**:` ‚Üê Restore user architecture patterns
  - `**Integration Strategy**:` ‚Üê Restore user API/service config
  - `**Advanced Constraints**:` ‚Üê Restore user technical limitations

**Working Relationship DNA**:
```bash
# Restore AI collaboration preferences
# Source: upgrade-temp/02-ai-collaboration-customizations.md
```

**Target Locations**:
- **Advanced Practitioner Profile** customizations
- **Communication Style** preferences
- **Trust & Delegation** frameworks
- **Quality Standards** specifications

#### **üü† IMPORTANT - Restore Second** (Productivity Impact)

**Active Session Context**:
```bash
# Restore current work state
# Source: upgrade-temp/03-session-management-customizations.md
```

**Intelligent Session Restoration**:
- **Current Session Focus** ‚Üí Map to new session lens structure
- **Supporting Tasks** ‚Üí Restore with updated format requirements
- **Surgical Boundaries** ‚Üí Preserve scope exclusions
- **Active Working State** ‚Üí Update to enhanced context tracking

**Custom Problem-Solving Methods**:
```bash
# Restore methodology customizations
# Source: upgrade-temp/04-problem-solving-customizations.md
```

#### **üü° OPTIONAL - Restore Last** (Enhancement Value)

**Learning Artifacts & Documentation**:
```bash
# Restore knowledge customizations
# Source: upgrade-temp/05-learning-capture-customizations.md
# Source: upgrade-temp/06-system-deployment-customizations.md
```

### **Phase 4: Conflict Resolution & Intelligent Merging**

#### **HTML Trigger Preservation Strategy**

**Scenario 1: Enhanced Interview Patterns**
```html
<!-- OLD (Preserved User Response) -->
<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Interview user about project specifics -->
User Response: "Build content management system for technical docs"

<!-- NEW (V3 Enhanced) -->  
<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Interview user about project specifics, technical stack, and advanced collaboration preferences. Use proven question sequences for writers, coders, and content creators breaking out of standard AI interfaces. -->

<!-- RESTORATION STRATEGY -->
1. Keep enhanced V3 trigger for future interviews
2. Restore user response content to corresponding placeholder
3. Preserve trigger sophistication while maintaining user data
```

**Scenario 2: Structural Reorganization**
```markdown
# OLD STRUCTURE (User Customized)
## Project Goals
User Content: "Advanced document automation system"

# NEW STRUCTURE (V3 Enhanced)
## üéØ Project Mission ^project-mission
**What We're Building**: <!-- Core project purpose and advanced practitioner value -->

# RESTORATION STRATEGY
1. Map user content to new structured format
2. Preserve content meaning and specificity
3. Enhance with new framework organization
```

**Scenario 3: New Sections Added**
```markdown
# NEW V3 SECTION (Not in old template)
## ‚ö° V3 Performance Targets ^performance-targets
**Token Optimization**: <!-- Vault boundaries preventing 21.6M+ token explosion -->

# RESTORATION STRATEGY  
1. Leave new placeholders for fresh configuration
2. Migrate related user content from other sections if applicable
3. Preserve V3 performance optimization structure
```

#### **Content Preservation Rules**

**Always Preserve**:
- ‚úÖ User project-specific content
- ‚úÖ Custom technical configurations  
- ‚úÖ Active session work state
- ‚úÖ Personalized collaboration preferences
- ‚úÖ Custom methodologies and approaches

### **Phase 5: Restoration Execution**

#### **Template-by-Template Restoration**

**For each core template**:
1. **Backup current state** - Preserve new V3 template structure
2. **Load user customizations** - Read from corresponding extraction file
3. **Map content intelligently** - Apply conflict resolution rules
4. **Preserve V3 improvements** - Maintain framework enhancements
5. **Validate restoration** - Confirm content integrity and structure

**Restoration Commands**:
```bash
# Execute intelligent restoration for each template
# This process preserves both V3 improvements and user content

# 1. Project Requirements
# Merge: upgrade-temp/01-project-requirements-customizations.md ‚Üí core/00-PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md

# 2. AI Collaboration  
# Merge: upgrade-temp/02-ai-collaboration-customizations.md ‚Üí core/01-AI-COLLABORATION-CORE.md

# 3. Session Management
# Merge: upgrade-temp/03-session-management-customizations.md ‚Üí core/02-SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md

# 4. Problem Solving
# Merge: upgrade-temp/04-problem-solving-customizations.md ‚Üí core/03-PROBLEM-SOLVING-METHODS.md

# 5. Learning Capture
