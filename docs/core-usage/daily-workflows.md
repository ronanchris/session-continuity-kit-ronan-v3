## Core Daily Workflow Architecture

### Morning Initialization Protocol (5-10 minutes)

**Step 1: Session Lens Configuration**
```markdown
## 🎯 Today's Session Focus (4-6 Items Maximum)

**Primary Objective:** [Single most important outcome]

**Supporting Tasks:**
1. **[Critical Task]** - Status: Not Started | Tool: Cursor+V3
2. **[Essential Task]** - Status: Planning | Tool: [Specific]
3. **[Required Task]** - Status: [Progress] | Tool: [Specific]
4. **[Optional if time]** - Status: Deferred | Tool: [Specific]

**NOT doing today:** [Explicit exclusions for surgical focus]
**Deferred to tomorrow:** [Important items deliberately postponed]
```

**Step 2: Context Loading from Previous Session**
- Open `02-SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md` to review yesterday's active context
- Check interruption recovery breadcrumbs for precise resumption point
- Validate tool state (connections, configurations) from previous session
- Restore exact working location (file, function, paragraph) if applicable

**Step 3: Performance Baseline Check**
```bash
# Quick system validation
cursor --token-usage | head -5
ls -la .cursorindexignore  # Token protection active
grep -c "AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER" session-continuity-core/*.md  # HTML triggers ready
```

### Active Work Session Management

**Continuous Context Tracking:**
```markdown
## 🔄 Active Session Context

**Current Focus:** [Exact current task and reasoning chain]
**Working Location:** [File: line/function/section currently active]
**Tool State:** [Cursor connections, loaded configurations, active AI model]
**Next Action:** [Specific next step when resuming]
**Context Size:** [Estimated token count - target <15KB for 21% improvement]
```

**Session Lens Discipline (Every 60 minutes):**
- Review 4-6 item focus list for scope drift
- Assess if current work aligns with primary objective
- Document any implementation gaps discovered
- Adjust focus or defer items that exceed capacity

**HTML Trigger Utilization:**
```html
<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Current work requires specific guidance on [problem]. Interview about [specific aspects] and provide systematic approach matching enterprise-grade standards. -->
```

### Interruption Recovery Protocol (60-second restoration)

**Before Interruption (30 seconds):**
```markdown
## 🚨 Interruption Recovery Preparation

**Micro-Context:** [Exact problem being solved and current reasoning]
**File Location:** [Specific file, line number, function, or section]
**Thought State:** [Current analysis and planned next action]
**Tool Configuration:** [Active connections, AI model, relevant context loaded]
**Recovery Breadcrumb:** [Trail back to exact working point]
```

**After Interruption (30 seconds):**
1. **Context Restoration** - Read recovery breadcrumb and restore exact state
2. **Session Lens Check** - Verify 4-6 items still optimal for remaining time
3. **Tool Recovery** - Reconnect tools and reload relevant context
4. **Momentum Restoration** - Resume from exact interruption point with context intact
