# First-Time Setup Guide
*Advanced Practitioner Onboarding for Session Continuity V3*

## Overview

This guide transforms you from Session Continuity V3 installation to productive daily usage in 30 minutes. You'll activate all breakthrough capabilities including meta-collaboration intelligence, revolutionary template experience, and mathematical performance optimization.

## Prerequisites

- **Cursor or Windsurf** with active subscription
- **Intermediate-to-advanced AI collaboration experience**
- **GitHub repository access** or local Session Continuity V3 files
- **Systematic approach mindset** - this is enterprise-grade AI collaboration

## Phase 1: Installation (5 minutes)

### The Reality: 4 Commands
Session Continuity V3 installation is surgical precision - no complex automation needed.

```bash
# Step 1: Token Protection (enables 95% token reduction)
cp .cursorindexingignore.template .cursorindexingignore

# Step 2: Core Templates (6 surgical templates with breakthrough capabilities)
cp -r core/ session-continuity-core/

# Step 3: Cursor Rules (meta-collaboration intelligence activation)
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp starter-kit/cursor-rules.template.mdc .cursor/rules/session-continuity-v3.mdc

# Step 4: Restart Cursor to activate all systems
```

**That's it.** Four file operations deliver enterprise-grade AI collaboration.

### Verification: Is Everything Working?

Use this Cursor prompt to validate your installation:

```
Please analyze my current Session Continuity V3 installation and verify:

1. **Core Template Analysis**:
   - Scan my session-continuity-core/ directory and confirm all 6 templates are present
   - Check each template for HTML triggers (<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: -->)
   - Verify YAML frontmatter structure in each template
   - Test cross-references between templates work

2. **Cursor Rules Integration**:
   - Check .cursor/rules/ for session continuity .mdc files
   - Verify cursor rules have valid YAML structure
   - Confirm smart model routing configuration is operational

3. **Performance Setup**:
   - Verify .cursorindexingignore exists with comprehensive exclusion patterns
   - Confirm token protection is active for 95% reduction capability

4. **Integration Test**:
   - Find HTML triggers and explain what should happen when encountered
   - Verify session lens methodology is ready (4-6 items maximum)
   - Confirm breakthrough capabilities are operational

Provide specific feedback on what's working and concrete steps to fix any issues.
```

**Expected Response:** Cursor should identify all 6 templates, confirm HTML triggers are functional, validate cursor rules integration, and verify performance optimization is active.

## Phase 2: Revolutionary Template Experience (10 minutes)

### HTML Trigger Activation
Your V3 templates contain HTML triggers that transform static documentation into guided conversations:

```html
<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: Interview user about project specifics -->
```

**Test this now:**
1. Open any template in `session-continuity-core/`
2. Look for HTML comment triggers
3. Ask Cursor about one - it should launch guided customization

### Template Customization Workflow
1. **Choose your starting template** (00-PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md recommended)
2. **Encounter HTML trigger** - Cursor automatically launches interview
3. **Answer guided questions** - Enterprise sophistication through conversation
4. **Watch template transform** - Your content replaces placeholder comments
5. **Cross-reference validation** - Templates link to each other systematically

### Success Indicators
- **HTML triggers respond** with guided interviews automatically
- **Template customization** feels conversational, not intimidating  
- **Enterprise sophistication** maintained through systematic process
- **Cross-template relationships** preserved and functional

## Phase 3: Meta-Collaboration Intelligence (10 minutes)

### Self-Monitoring AI Activation
Session Continuity V3 includes breakthrough self-monitoring capability. Test this:

**Ask Cursor:** *"If the system were working optimally, wouldn't X happen automatically?"*

**Expected Behavior:** Cursor should analyze its own collaboration effectiveness and provide sophisticated diagnostic insights.

### Implementation Gap Detection
Use this methodology when collaboration breaks down:

1. **Question assumptions:** "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?"
2. **Diagnostic conversation:** Let Cursor analyze the collaboration gap
3. **Systematic improvement:** Apply insights to enhance partnership
4. **Recursive enhancement:** System gets better through usage

### Advanced Collaboration Patterns
- **Challenge AI assumptions** when outputs feel generic
- **Request meta-analysis** of collaboration effectiveness  
- **Use diagnostic conversations** for systematic improvement
- **Document breakthrough discoveries** in learning capture templates

## Phase 4: Session Lens Methodology (5 minutes)

### Mathematical Focus Optimization
Session lens methodology delivers 67% efficiency gains through 4-6 item maximum focus:

**Current Session Focus Template:**
```markdown
## 🎯 **Session Lens (4-6 Items Maximum)**

### **Primary Objective** (Single Core Mission)
<!-- Today's primary outcome that defines session success -->

### **Supporting Tasks** (3-5 Maximum Only)
1. **<!-- Essential task -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->
2. **<!-- Required task -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->  
3. **<!-- Critical task -->** - Status: <!-- Progress --> | Tool: <!-- Primary tool -->

### **Surgical Boundaries** (Essential for 67% Efficiency)
**NOT doing today**: <!-- Explicit scope exclusions -->
**Future session**: <!-- Important items deliberately deferred -->
```

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: 21% improvement baseline (14s → 11s)
- **Token Efficiency**: 95% reduction through systematic boundaries
- **Cost Optimization**: $100+/day → <$10/day for systematic users
- **Focus Discipline**: 4-6 items maximum prevents confusion

## Phase 5: Daily Workflow Integration (Final validation)

### Morning Activation Routine
1. **Open session management template** (02-SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md)
2. **Set session lens focus** (4-6 items maximum)
3. **Activate HTML triggers** for guided customization
4. **Begin systematic collaboration** with breakthrough capabilities

### Success Validation Checklist
- [ ] **HTML triggers respond** with guided interviews
- [ ] **Meta-collaboration intelligence** provides diagnostic insights
- [ ] **Session lens methodology** maintains 4-6 item focus
- [ ] **Performance optimization** delivers faster responses
- [ ] **Cross-template integration** preserves relationships
- [ ] **Enterprise-grade reliability** through systematic approach

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### HTML Triggers Not Responding
**Symptoms:** AI doesn't launch guided interviews when encountering triggers
**Solutions:**
- Restart Cursor to activate .mdc rules
- Check .cursor/rules/session-continuity-v3.mdc exists
- Verify YAML structure in cursor rules file
- Test with different template files

#### Performance Not Improving
**Symptoms:** No speed increase, high token usage continues
**Solutions:**
- Verify .cursorindexingignore copied correctly
- Check exclusion patterns include heavy directories
- Restart Cursor after configuration changes
- Monitor token usage in Cursor interface

#### Templates Not Cross-Referencing
**Symptoms:** Links between templates broken or non-functional
**Solutions:**
- Verify all 6 templates copied to session-continuity-core/
- Check YAML frontmatter linked-notes sections
- Test block reference system (^block-id patterns)
- Validate file naming consistency

#### Meta-Collaboration Not Working
**Symptoms:** Cursor doesn't provide diagnostic insights when questioned
**Solutions:**
- Use specific trigger phrases: "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?"
- Ask direct questions about collaboration effectiveness
- Request meta-analysis of current partnership quality
- Challenge AI when outputs feel generic or superficial
