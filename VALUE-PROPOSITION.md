# Session Continuity V3 - Value Proposition

## Revolutionary AI Collaboration for Advanced Practitioners

### ðŸŽ¯ **The Advanced Practitioner Problem**

Writers, coders, and content creators using Cursor/Windsurf face the same frustration: **every session starts from scratch**. The AI forgets your project context, your systematic approach, your working relationship. You waste time re-explaining, lose momentum on interruptions, and watch costs explode from inefficient token usage.

**Advanced practitioners need systematic AI partnership, not scattered assistance.**
